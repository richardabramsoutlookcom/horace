# Milestone v1.0: Authentic Spectrum Experience

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-18
**Phases:** 1-5
**Total Plans:** 12

## Overview

Transform the existing browser game into an authentic ZX Spectrum experience. Starting with visual foundation (resolution, palette, attribute blocks), then sprites, audio, gameplay tuning, and finally presentation polish. Each phase builds on the previous, with the final result feeling like the original 1982 game.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Visual Foundation

**Goal**: Establish authentic ZX Spectrum visual rendering
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: VIS-01, VIS-02, VIS-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Canvas renders at 256x192 native resolution
  2. All on-screen colors match exact ZX Spectrum palette
  3. Color areas show visible attribute block constraints (8x8)
**Plans**: 2 plans
**Completed**: 2026-01-18

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Resolution & Palette — Set 256x192 canvas, implement ZX_PALETTE constant
- [x] 01-02: Attribute System — Implement 8x8 attribute blocks and color clash

### Phase 2: Authentic Sprites

**Goal**: Replace placeholder graphics with authentic Spectrum-style sprites
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: VIS-04, VIS-05, VIS-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Horace is recognizable as blue blob with big eyes and tail
  2. Road scene uses authentic Spectrum colors and style
  3. Ski slope has red/blue flag gates and authentic trees
**Plans**: 3 plans
**Completed**: 2026-01-18

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Horace Sprite — Create 16x20 pixel data and drawHorace function
- [x] 02-02: Road Sprites — Blocky vehicle sprites with direction-based coloring
- [x] 02-03: Ski Sprites — Flag gates and tree obstacles

### Phase 3: Authentic Audio

**Goal**: Replace modern sounds with authentic beeper audio
**Depends on**: Phase 1 (can run parallel to Phase 2)
**Requirements**: AUD-01, AUD-02, AUD-03, AUD-04, AUD-05, AUD-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All sounds use square wave (no smooth waveforms)
  2. Only one sound plays at a time
  3. Gate pass/miss, crash, and jump sounds feel authentic
**Plans**: 2 plans
**Completed**: 2026-01-18

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Square Wave Foundation — Single-channel audio, square wave oscillators
- [x] 03-02: Game Sounds — Gate miss, ski jump, and collision sounds

### Phase 4: Gameplay & Timing

**Goal**: Tune gameplay to match original feel
**Depends on**: Phase 1, Phase 2
**Requirements**: TIME-01, TIME-02, TIME-03, GAME-01 through GAME-11
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Game runs at consistent 50 Hz
  2. Economic system works ($40 start, $10 fees/bonuses)
  3. Gate scoring works (points for pass, penalty for miss)
  4. Tree collisions have variable outcome
  5. Traffic behaves authentically
**Plans**: 3 plans
**Completed**: 2026-01-18

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: 50Hz Loop — Fixed timestep accumulator, discrete road movement
- [x] 04-02: Economic System — Money tracking, ambulance fees, ski rental, bonuses
- [x] 04-03: Scoring & Collision — Gate scoring fix, variable tree outcomes, ski jump

### Phase 5: Presentation

**Goal**: Complete authentic UI presentation
**Depends on**: Phase 1, Phase 4
**Requirements**: PRES-01, PRES-02, PRES-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Text displays in 8x8 bitmap Spectrum font
  2. Score and money display in authentic positions
  3. Title screen matches original presentation
**Plans**: 2 plans
**Completed**: 2026-01-18

Plans:
- [x] 05-01: Spectrum Font & HUD — ROM font data, drawText function, canvas HUD
- [x] 05-02: Title Screen — MODE.TITLE, drawTitle, game flow integration

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Cyan for pavements (ZX Spectrum had no gray)
- Red for tree trunks (ZX Spectrum had no brown)
- 16x20 sprite size (fits within 2x3 attribute blocks)
- Single-channel audio (beeper could only play one sound at a time)
- 50Hz fixed timestep (authentic PAL timing)
- Discrete step road movement (matches original feel)
- 30/70 bounce/crash tree collision (creates unpredictability)

**Issues Resolved:**

- Gate miss scoring (penalty not death, matches original)
- Variable tree collision outcomes
- Ski jump mechanic for obstacle avoidance

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- None significant — clean implementation
